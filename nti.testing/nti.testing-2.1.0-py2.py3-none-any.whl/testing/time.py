def time_monotonically_increases(func_or_granularity):
    """
    Decorate a unittest method with this function to cause the value
    of :func:`time.time` to monotonically increase by one each time it
    is called. This ensures things like last modified dates always
    increase.

    We make three guarantees about the value of :func:`time.time`
    returned while the decorated function is running:

    1. It is always *at least* the value of the *real* :func:`time.time`;
    2. Each call returns a value greater than the previous call;
    3. Those two constraints hold across different invocations of functions
       decorated.

    This decorator can be applied to a method in a test case::

        class TestThing(unittest.TestCase)
            @time_monotonically_increases
            def test_method(self):
              t = time.time()
               ...

    It can also be applied to a bare function taking any number of arguments::

        @time_monotonically_increases
        def utility_function(a, b, c=1):
           t = time.time()
           ...

    By default, the time will be incremented in 1.0 second intervals. You can
    specify a particular granularity as an argument; this is useful to keep from
    running too far ahead of the real clock::

        @time_monotonically_increases(0.1)
        def smaller_increment():
            t1 = time.time()
            t2 = time.time()
            assrt t2 == t1 + 0.1

    .. versionchanged:: 2.0
       The decorated function returns whatever the passed function returns.
    .. versionchanged:: 2.0
       Properly handle more than one argument to the underlying function.
    .. versionchanged:: 2.0
       Ensure that the values returned are at least the real time. Previously
       they were integers starting at 0.
    .. versionchanged:: 2.0
       Ensure that the values returned are increasing even across different
       invocations of a decorated function or different decorated functions. Previously
       different functions would return the same sequence.
    .. versionchanged:: 2.0
       Allow specifying the granularity of clock increments. Keep at
       1.0 seconds for backwards compatibility by default.
