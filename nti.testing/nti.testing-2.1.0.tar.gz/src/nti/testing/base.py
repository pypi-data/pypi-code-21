# The cleanup that we get by importing just zope.interface and

# that cause the use of interfaces as functions to direct through the
# current site manager (as does the global component API). This
# adapter hook is a cached function of an implementation detail of the
# site manager: siteManager.adapters.adapter_hook.
#
# If no site is ever set, this caches the adapter_hook of the globalSiteManager.
#
# When the zope.component cleanup runs, it swizzles out the internals
# of the globalSiteManager by re-running __init__. However, it does
# not clear the cached adapter_hook. Thus, subsequent uses of the
# adapter hook (interface calls, or use of the global component API)
# continue to use the *old* adapter registry (which is no longer easy
# to access and inspect, especially when the C hook optimizations are
# in use) If any non-ZCML registrations are made (or the next test
# loads a subset of the ZCML the previous test did) then this
# manifests as strange adapter failures.
#
# This is obviously all implementation detail. So rather than "fix" the problem
# ourself, the solution is to import zope.site.site to ensure that the site gets
# cleaned up and the adapter_hook cache thrown away
# This problem never manifests itself in code that has already imported zope.site,
# and it seems to be an assumption that code that uses zope.component also uses zope.site
